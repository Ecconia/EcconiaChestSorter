# Ecconia's Chest Sorter

## For?

Minecraft Fabric 1.20.1\
Also requires the Fabric-API.

## What does it do?

On a keypress it will sort the content of "generic" chests and shulker boxes by ID, it will stack items when possible.

The key can be configured in the Minecraft key binding settings.

## Why another one?

Because apparently all the others I found (even though they have more features and are better), need a server mod.

This mod runs on the client fully. It does not need a server mod.

## Warning, hacking?

Currently, this mod will spam slot interaction packets to the server (one for each simulated mouse-click).\
A vanilla server and Spigot do not seem to mind this.\
But if the server has an anti-cheat protection, this mod will not try to hide the automation.

**You have been warned, this mod can get you banned for packet spam!**
